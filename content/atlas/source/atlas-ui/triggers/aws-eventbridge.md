# Send Trigger Events to AWS EventBridge

MongoDB offers an [AWS Eventbridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) partner event source that lets you send Atlas Trigger events to an event bus instead of calling an Atlas Function. You can configure any Trigger type to send events to EventBridge. Database Triggers also support custom error handling, to reduce Trigger suspensions due to non-critical errors. All you need to send Trigger events to EventBridge is an AWS account ID. This guide walks you through finding your account ID, configuring the Trigger, associating the Trigger event source with an event bus, and setting up custom error handling.

> **Note:**
> This guide is based on Amazon's [Receiving Events from a SaaS Partner](/eventbridge/latest/userguide/create-partner-event-bus.html) documentation.

## Procedure

> **Note:**
> Individual entries for an EventBridge Trigger event must be smaller than 256 KB. Learn how to reduce the size of your `PutEvents` entry in the Performance Optimization section.

1. **Set Up the MongoDB Partner Event Source**

   To send Trigger events to AWS EventBridge, you need the **AWS account ID** of the account that should receive the events.

   1. Open the [Amazon EventBridge console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/) and click **Partner event sources** in the navigation menu.
   2. Search for the **MongoDB** partner event source and then click **Set up**.
   3. From the **MongoDB** partner event source page, click **Copy** to copy your AWS account ID to the clipboard.

1. **Configure the Trigger**

   After you have the **AWS account ID**, you can configure a Database Trigger or Scheduled Trigger to send events to EventBridge. You can configure the Trigger in the Atlas UI or using the App Services CLI.

   **Atlas UI**

   In the Atlas UI, create and configure a new Database Trigger or Scheduled Trigger with the following settings:

   1. Select **EventBridge** as the event type.
   2. Paste the **AWS Account ID** that you copied from EventBridge.
   3. Select an **AWS Region** to send the Trigger events to.

      > **Note:**
      > For a full list of supported AWS regions, refer to Amazon's [Receiving Events from a SaaS Partner](/eventbridge/latest/userguide/create-partner-event-bus.html) guide.

   4. *(Optional for Database Triggers Only)* Configure a Function to handle Trigger errors. For more details, refer to the Custom Error Handling section on this page.

      ![The EventBridge input boxes in the Trigger configuration.](/images/triggers/eventbridge-trigger-config.png)

   5. To enable Extended JSON, toggle the **Enable Extended JSON** setting in the **Advanced (Optional)** section. By default, Triggers convert the BSON types in event objects into standard JSON types. Enabling Extended JSON preserves BSON type information by serializing event objects into [Extended JSON format](/reference/mongodb-extended-json) instead. This preserves type information at the expense of readability and interoperability.
   ---

   **App Services CLI**

   1. Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas User

      Use your MongoDB Atlas Administration API Key to log in to the App Services CLI:

      ```shell
      appservices login --api-key="<API KEY>" --private-api-key="<PRIVATE KEY>"
      ```

   2. Pull Your App's Latest Configuration Files

      Run the following command to get a local copy of your configuration files:

      ```shell
      appservices pull --remote=<App ID>
      ```

      By default, the command pulls files into the current working directory. You can specify a directory path with the optional `--local` flag.

   3. Create a trigger configuration file in your local `/triggers` directory. Omit the `function_name` field and define an `AWS_EVENTBRIDGE` event processor.
   4. Set the `account_id` field to the **AWS Account ID** that you copied from EventBridge.
   5. Set the `region` field to an AWS Region.

      > **Note:**
      > For a full list of supported AWS regions, refer to Amazon's [Receiving Events from a SaaS Partner](/eventbridge/latest/userguide/create-partner-event-bus.html) guide.

   6. To enable Extended JSON, set the `extended_json_enabled` field to `true`. By default, Triggers convert the BSON types in event objects into standard JSON types. Enabling Extended JSON preserves BSON type information by serializing event objects into [Extended JSON format](/reference/mongodb-extended-json) instead. This preserves type information at the expense of readability and interoperability.
   7. *(Optional for Database Triggers Only)* Configure a Function to handle Trigger errors. For more details, refer to the Custom Error Handling section on this page.

   The Trigger configuration file should resemble the following:

   ```json
   {
      "name": "...",
      "type": "...",
      "event_processors": {
         "AWS_EVENTBRIDGE": {
            "config": {
               "account_id": "<AWS Account ID>",
               "region": "<AWS Region>",
               "extended_json_enabled": <boolean>
            }
         }
      }
   }
   ```

   ---

1. **Associate the Trigger Event Source with an Event Bus**

   Return to the EventBridge console.

   1. Select Partner event sources in the navigation pane.
   2. In the **Partner event sources** table, find and select the **Pending** Trigger source, then click **Associate with event bus**.
   3. On the **Associate with event bus** screen, define any required access permissions for other accounts and organizations, then click **Associate**.

   After the association is confirmed, the status of the Trigger event source changes from **Pending** to **Active**, and the name of the event bus updates to match the event source name. You can now create rules that trigger on events from that partner event source. For more information, see [Creating a Rule that Triggers on a SaaS Partner Event](/eventbridge/latest/userguide/create-rule-partner-events.html).

## Custom Error Handling

> **Note:**
> Currently, only Database Triggers support custom error handling. Authentication Triggers and Scheduled Triggers do not support custom error handling at this time.

You can create an error handler to execute on a Trigger failure when retry does not succeed. Custom error handling allows you to determine whether an error from AWS EventBridge is critical enough to suspend the Trigger, or if it is acceptable to ignore the error and continue processing other events. For more information on suspended Database Triggers, refer to Suspended Triggers.

### Create a New Custom Error Handler

You can create a new error handler in the Atlas UI, using the App Services CLI, or through the App Services Admin API.

**Atlas UI**

This procedure walks you through how to create the new Function directly in the **Create a Trigger** page. You can also create the Function from the **Functions** page. For more information on how to define Functions in Atlas, refer to Define a Function.

![The EventBridge custom error handling configuration in the UI.](/images/triggers/eventbridge-custom-function.png)

1. **Create a New Error Handler**

   From the **Configure Error Function** section of the **Create a Trigger** page, select **+ NewFunction**. You can also select an existing Function, if one is already defined, from the dropdown.

1. **Name the New Function**

   Enter a unique identifying name for the Function in the **Name** field. This name must be distinct from all other Functions in the application.

1. **Write the Function Code**

   In the **Function** section, write the JavaScript code directly in the Function editor. The Function editor contains a default Function that you can edit as needed. For more information on creating Functions, refer to the Functions documentation.

1. **Test the Function**

   In the **Testing Console** tab beneath the Function editor, you can test the Function by passing in example values to the `error` and `changeEvent` parameters, as shown in the comments of the testing console. For more information on these parameters, refer to the Error Handler Parameters section on this page. Click **Run** to run the test.

1. **Save the Function**

   Once you are satisfied with the custom error handler, click **Save**.

---

**App Services CLI**

You can update your trigger's configuration with an error handler using the App Services CLI. For more information, see the Update an App procedure.

1. **Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas User**

   Use your MongoDB Atlas Administration API Key to log in to the App Services CLI:

   ```shell
   appservices login --api-key="<API KEY>" --private-api-key="<PRIVATE KEY>"
   ```

1. **Pull Your App's Latest Configuration Files**

   Run the following command to get a local copy of your configuration files:

   ```shell
   appservices pull --remote=<App ID>
   ```

   By default, the command pulls files into the current working directory. You can specify a directory path with the optional `--local` flag.

1. **Write the Error Handler**

   Follow the steps in Define a Function to write your error handler source code and configuration file. See the following template error handler as an example:

   ```js
   exports = async function(error, changeEvent) {
      // This sample function will log additional details if the error is not
      // a DOCUMENT_TOO_LARGE error
      if (error.code === 'DOCUMENT_TOO_LARGE') {
         console.log('Document too large error');
   
         // Comment out the line below in order to skip this event and not suspend the Trigger
         throw new Error('Encountered error: ${error.code}');
      }
   
      console.log('Error sending event to EventBridge');
      console.log('DB: ${changeEvent.ns.db}');
      console.log('Collection: ${changeEvent.ns.coll}');
      console.log('Operation type: ${changeEvent.operationType}');
   
      // Throw an error in your Function to suspend the Trigger
      // and stop processing additional events
      throw new Error('Encountered error: ${error.message}');
   };
   ```

   For more information on creating Functions, see Functions.

1. **Add the Error Handler to Your Trigger Configuration**

   Add an `error_handler` attribute to your Trigger configuration file in the `Triggers` folder. The Trigger configuration file should resemble the following:

   ```json
         {
            "name": "...",
            "type": "DATABASE",
            "event_processors": {
               "AWS_EVENTBRIDGE": {
                  "config": {
                     "account_id": "<AWS Account ID>",
                     "region": "<AWS Region>",
                     "extended_json_enabled": <boolean>
                  }
               }
            },
            "error_handler": {
               "config": {
                  "enabled": <boolean>,
                  "function_name": "<Error Handler Function Name>"
               }
            }
         }
   ```

   For more information, see Trigger Configuration Files.

1. **Deploy Your Changes**

   Run the following command to deploy your changes:

   ```shell
   appservices push
   ```

---

**App Services API**

> **Note:**
> This procedure refers to App Services Admin API endpoints. It does *not* use Atlas Administration API endpoints.

1. **Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas User**

   Call the Login endpoint with your MongoDB Atlas Administration API key pair:

   ```shell
   curl -X POST \
     https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/auth/providers/mongodb-cloud/login \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -H 'Accept: application/json' \
     -d '{
       "username": "<Public API Key>",
       "apiKey": "<Private API Key>"
     }'
   ```

   If authentication succeeds, the response body contains a JSON object with an `access_token` value:

   ```json
   {
     "access_token": "<access_token>",
     "refresh_token": "<refresh_token>",
     "user_id": "<user_id>",
     "device_id": "<device_id>"
   }
   ```

   The `access_token` grants access to the App Services Admin API. You must include it as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header for all App Services Admin API requests.

   > **See also:**
   > App Services Admin API Authentication documentation

1. **Create a Deployment Draft (Optional)**

   A draft represents a group of application changes that you can deploy or discard as a single unit. If you don't create a draft, updates automatically deploy individually. To create a draft, send a `POST` request with no body to the Create a Deployment Draft endpoint:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST 'https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/drafts' \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   -H 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>'
   ```

1. **Create the Error Handler Function**

   Create the Function to handle errors for a failed AWS EventBridge Trigger via a `POST` request to the Create a new Function endpoint.

   ```bash
   curl -X POST \
      https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/functions \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \
      -d '{
            "name": "string",
            "private": true,
            "source": "string",
            "run_as_system": true
         }'
   ```

1. **Create the AWS EventBridge Trigger**

   Create the AWS EventBridge Trigger with error handling enabled via a `POST` request to the Create a Trigger endpoint.

   ```bash
   curl -X POST \
      https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/triggers \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \
      -d '{
            "name": "string",
            "type": "DATABASE",
            "config": {
               "service_id": "string",
               "database": "string",
               "collection": "string",
               "operation_types": {
                  "string"
               },
               "match": ,
               "full_document": false,
               "full_document_before_change": false,
               "unordered": true
            },
            "event_processors": {
               "AWS_EVENTBRIDGE": {
                  "account_id": "string",
                  "region": "string",
                  "extended_json_enabled": false
               },
            },
            "error_handler": {
               "enabled": true,
               "function_id": "string"
            }
         }'
   ```

1. **Deploy Your Changes**

   If you created a draft, you can deploy all changes in the draft by sending a `POST` request with no body to the Deploy a deployment draft endpoint. If you did not create a draft as a first step, the individual Function and Trigger requests deploy automatically.

   ```shell
   curl -X POST \
   'https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/drafts/{draftId}/deployment' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   --header 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \
   ```

### Error Handler Parameters

The default error handler has two parameters: `error` and `changeEvent`.

#### `error`

Has the following two attributes:

- `code`: The code for the errored EventBridge put request. For a list of error codes used by the error handler, refer to the Error Codes section on this page.
- `message`: The unfiltered error message from an errored EventBridge put request.

#### `changeEvent`

The requested change to your data made by EventBridge. For more information on types of change events and their configurations, see Change Event Types.

### Error Codes

If an error was received from EventBridge, the event processor will parse the error as either `DOCUMENT_TOO_LARGE` or `OTHER`. This parsed error is passed to the error handler Function through the `error` parameter.

#### `DOCUMENT_TOO_LARGE`

If the entry for an EventBridge Trigger event is larger than 256 KB, EventBridge will throw an error. The error will contain either:

- [status code: 400](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400) and `total size of the entries in the request is over the limit`.
- [status code: 413](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/413), which indicates a too large payload.

For more information on reducing entry size, see Performance Optimization.

#### `OTHER`

The default bucket for all other errors.

> **Tip:**
> You can make special error handling cases for your most common error messages to optimize your error handling for errors with an `OTHER` code. To determine which errors need special cases, we recommended keeping track of the most common error messages you receive in `error.message`.

### Error Handler Logs

You can view Trigger Error Handler logs for your EventBridge Trigger error handler in the application logs.

**Atlas UI**

From the `Triggers` page of the Atlas UI, select the **Logs** tab. All logs display by default. To view only error handler logs, click the **Show errors only** toggle.
---

**App Services CLI**

Pass the `trigger_error_handler` value to the `--type` flag to view all error handler logs.

```shell
appservices logs list --type=trigger_error_handler
```

---

**App Services API**

> **Note:**
> This procedure refers to App Services Admin API endpoints. It does *not* use Atlas Administration API endpoints.

Retrieve `TRIGGER_ERROR_HANDLER` type logs via a `GET` request to the Retrieve App Services Logs endpoint:

```shell
curl -X GET 'https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/logs' \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   -H 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>'
   -d '{
      "type": "TRIGGER_ERROR_HANDLER"
      }'
```

---

To learn more about viewing application logs, see View Application Logs.

## Example Event

The following object configures a Trigger to send events to AWS EventBridge and handle errors:

```json
"event_processors": {
   "AWS_EVENTBRIDGE": {
      "config": {
         "account_id": "012345678901",
         "region": "us-east-1"
      }
   }
},
 "error_handler": {
   "config": {
      "enabled": true,
      "function_name": "myErrorHandler.js"
   }
}
```

## Performance Optimization

Individual entries for an EventBridge Trigger event must be smaller than 256 KB. For more information, see the [AWS Documentation to calculate Amazon PutEvents event entry size](/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-putevents.html#eb-putevent-size). When using Database Triggers, the Project Expression can include only specified fields, reducing document size before sending messages to EventBridge. For more details about Project Expression, refer to the Database Trigger Project Expression documentation.
