# Context

Atlas Functions have access to a global `context` object that contains metadata for the incoming requests and provides access to components and services in your App. The `context` object exposes the following interfaces:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| context.app | Access metadata about the app running the Function. |
| context.environment | Access environment values and the current environment tag. |
| context.functions | A client object that calls your app's Functions. |
| context.http | A built-in HTTP client. |
| context.request | Describes the incoming request that triggered a Function call. |
| context.services | Exposes client objects that can access data sources and services. |
| context.user | Describes the user that initiated the request. |
| context.values | Contains static global values. |

## Get App Metadata (`context.app`)

The `context.app` object contains metadata about the App that contains the Function.

```typescript
{
  "id": string,
  "clientAppId": string,
  "name": string,
  "projectId": string,
  "deployment": {
    "model": string,
    "providerRegion": string,
  },
  "lastDeployed": string,
  "hostingUri": string,
}
```

### context.app.id

The unique internal ID of the App that contains the Function.

```json
"60c8e59866b0c33d14ee634a"
```

### context.app.clientAppId

The unique Client App ID for the App that contains the Function.

```json
"myapp-abcde"
```

### context.app.name

The name of the App that contains the Function.

```json
"myapp"
```

### context.app.projectId

The ID of the Atlas Project that contains the App.

```json
"5e1ec444970199272441a214"
```

### context.app.deployment

An object that describes the App's deployment model and region.

```json
{
   "model": "LOCAL",
   "providerRegion": "aws-us-east-1"
}
```

### context.app.lastDeployed

The date and time that the App was last deployed, formatted as an ISODate string.

```javascript
"2022-10-31T12:00:00.000Z"
```

### context.app.hostingUri

If static hosting is enabled, this value is the base URL for hosted assets. (Static Hosting is deprecated. Learn more.)

```json
"myapp-abcde.mongodbstitch.com"
```

## Call a Function (`context.functions`)

You can call any Function in your application through the `context.functions` interface.

### context.functions.execute()

Calls a specific Function and returns the result.

```javascript
context.functions.execute(functionName, ...args)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `functionName` | string | The name of the Function. |
| `args`... | mixed | A variadic list of arguments to pass to the Function. Each Function parameter maps to a separate, comma-separated argument. |

```javascript
// difference: subtracts b from a using the sum function
exports = function(a, b) {
      return context.functions.execute("sum", a, -1 * b);
};
```

## Check the App Environment (`context.environment`)

You can access information about your App's current environment configuration and access environment-specific values through the `context.environment` interface.

### context.environment.tag

The name of the app's current environment as a string. Possible values:

- `""`
- `"development"`
- `"testing"`
- `"qa"`
- `"production"`

```javascript
exports = async function() {
   switch(context.environment.tag) {
      case "": {
      return "There is no current environment"
      }
      case "development": {
      return "The current environment is development"
      }
      case "testing": {
      return "The current environment is testing"
      }
      case "qa": {
      return "The current environment is qa"
      }
      case "production": {
      return "The current environment is production"
      }
   }
};
```

### context.environment.values

An object where each field maps the name of an environment value to its value in the current environment.

```javascript
exports = async function() {
   const baseUrl = context.environment.values.baseUrl
};
```

## Connect to a MongoDB Data Source or Third-Party Service (`context.services`)

You can access a client for a linked MongoDB Atlas cluster or federated data source through the `context.services` interface.

### context.services.get()

Gets a service client for the specified service or `undefined` if no such service exists.

```javascript
context.services.get(serviceName)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `serviceName` | string | The name of the linked cluster, federated database instance, or service. Linked data sources created by your app use one of the following default names: - Cluster: `mongodb-atlas` - federated database instance: `mongodb-datafederation` |

```javascript
exports = async function() {
   // Get the cluster's data source client
   const mdb = context.services.get("mongodb-atlas");
   // Reference a specific database/collection
   const db = mdb.db("myApp");
   const collection = db.collection("myCollection");
   // Run a MongoDB query
   return await collection.find({
      name: "Rupert",
      age: { $lt: 50 },
   })
};
```

## Get Request Metadata (`context.request`)

You can access information about the incoming request with the context.request interface.

> **Tip:**
> The `context.request` interface does not include request body payloads.

### context.request

An object that contains information about the HTTP request that caused the Function to execute.

```javascript
{
   "remoteIPAddress": <string>,
   "requestHeaders": <object>,
   "webhookUrl": <string>,
   "httpMethod": <string>,
   "rawQueryString": <string>,
   "httpReferrer": <string>,
   "httpUserAgent": <string>,
   "service": <string>,
   "action": <string>
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `remoteIPAddress` | string | The IP address of the client that issued the Function request. |
| `requestHeaders` | object | An object where each field maps to a type of HTTP Header that was included in the request that caused the Function to execute. The value of each field is an array of strings where each string maps to a header of the specified type that was included in the request. |
| `webhookUrl` | string | Optional. In HTTPS endpoint Functions, the route of the endpoint. |
| `httpMethod` | string | Optional. In HTTPS endpoint Functions, the HTTP method of the request that called the endpoint. |
| `rawQueryString` | string | The query string attached to the incoming HTTP request. All query parameters appear in the same order as they were specified. **Important!**  For security reasons, Atlas automatically removes any query string key/value pair where the key is `secret`. For example, if an incoming request has the query string `?secret=hello&someParam=42` then the `rawQueryString` for that request is `"someParam=42"`. |
| `httpReferrer` | string | Optional. The URL of the page from which the request was sent. This value is derived from the HTTP Referer header. If the request did not include a `Referer` header then this is `undefined`. |
| `httpUserAgent` | string | Optional. Characteristic information that identifies the source of the request, such as the software vendor, operating system, or application type. This value is derived from the HTTP User-Agent header. If the request did not include a `User-Agent` header then this is `undefined`. |

The following `context.request` document reflects a Function call issued from `https://myapp.example.com/` by a user browsing with Chrome 73 on macOS High Sierra:

**Input:**

```javascript
exports = function() {
   return context.request
}
```

**Output:**

```json
{
   "remoteIPAddress": "54.173.82.137",
   "httpReferrer": "https://myapp.example.com/",
   "httpUserAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_13_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/73.0.3683.103 Safari/537.36",
   "rawQueryString": "?someParam=foo&anotherParam=42",
   "requestHeaders": {
      "Content-Type": ["application/json"],
      "Cookie": [
      "someCookie=someValue",
      "anotherCookie=anotherValue"
      ]
   }
}
```

## Get User Data (`context.user`)

You can access information about the application or system user that called a Function with the `context.user` interface.

### context.user

The user object of the authenticated user that called the Function.

```javascript
{
      "id": <string>,
      "type": <string>,
      "data": <document>,
      "identities": <array>
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | A string representation of the [ObjectId](/reference/bson-types/#objectid) that uniquely identifies the user. |
| `type` | string | The type of the user. The following types are possible: |
| Type | Description |  |
| "normal" | The user is an application user logged in through an authentication provider other than the API Key provider. |  |
| "server" | The user is a server process logged in with any type of App Services API Key. |  |
| "system" | The user is the system user that bypasses all rules. |  |
| `data` | document | A document that contains metadata that describes the user. This field combines the data for all `identities` associated with the user, so the exact field names and values depend on which authentication providers the user has authenticated with. In system functions, the `user.data` object is empty. Use context.runningAsSystem() to test if the function is running as a system user. |
| `custom_data` | document | A document from your application's custom user data collection that specifies the user's ID. You can use the custom user data collection to store arbitrary data about your application's users. If you set the `name` field, App Services populates the `username` metadata field with the return value of `name`. App Services automatically fetches a new copy of the data whenever a user refreshes their access token, such as when they log in. The underlying data is a regular MongoDB document, so you can use standard CRUD operations through the MongoDB Atlas service to define and modify the user's custom data. Custom user data is limited to `16MB`, the maximum size of a MongoDB document. To avoid hitting this limit, consider storing small and relatively static user data in each custom user data document, such as the user's preferred language or the URL of their avatar image. For data that is large, unbounded, or frequently updated, consider only storing a reference to the data in the custom user document or storing the data with a reference to the user's ID rather than in the custom user document. |
| `identities` | array | A list of authentication provider identities associated with the user. When a user first logs in with a specific provider, App Services associates the user with an identity object that contains a unique identifier and additional metadata about the user from the provider. For subsequent logins, App Services refreshes the existing identity data but does not create a new identity. Identity objects have the following form: { "id": "<Unique ID>", "provider_type": "<Provider Name>", "data": { "<Metadata Field>": <Value>, ... } } |
| Field Name | Description |  |
| `id` | A provider-generated string that uniquely identifies this identity. |  |
| `provider_type` | The type of authentication provider associated with this identity. |  |
| `data` | Additional metadata from the authentication provider that describes the user. The exact field names and values will vary depending on which authentication providers the user has logged in with. |  |

### context.runningAsSystem()

Evaluates to a boolean that is `true` if the Function is running as a system user.

```javascript
exports = function() {
   const isSystemUser = context.runningAsSystem()
   if(isSystemUser) {
      // Do some work with the system user.
   } else {
      // Fail.
   }
}
```

## Reference a Value (`context.values`)

You can access your app's static values in a Function with the `context.values` interface.

### context.values.get(valueName)

Gets the data associated with the provided Value name or `undefined` if no such value exists. This data is either a plain text JSON value or a Secret exposed through a value.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `valueName` | string | The name of the Value. |

```javascript
exports = function() {
   // Get a global value (or `undefined` if no Value has the specified name)
   const theme = context.values.get("theme");
   console.log(theme.colors)     // Output: { red: "#ee1111", blue: "#1111ee" }
   console.log(theme.colors.red) // Output: "#ee1111"
};
```

## Send an HTTP Request (`context.http`)

You can send HTTPS requests through a built-in client with the `context.http` interface.

### context.http.get()
