# Aggregate Data in MongoDB Atlas - Functions

The examples on this page demonstrate how to use the MongoDB Query API in an Atlas Function to aggregate documents in your Atlas cluster. MongoDB [aggregation pipelines](/core/aggregation-pipeline) run all documents in a collection through a series of data aggregation stages that allow you to filter and shape documents as well as collect summary data about groups of related documents.

> **Note:**
> Atlas Functions support nearly all MongoDB aggregation pipeline stages and operators, but some stages and operators must be executed within a system function. See Aggregation Framework Limitations for more information.

## Data Model

The examples on this page use a collection named `store.purchases` that contains information about historical item sales in an online store. Each document contains a list of the purchased `items`, including the item `name` and the purchased `quantity`, as well as a unique ID value for the customer that purchased the items.

```json
 :caption: The JSON schema for store.purchases

{
  "title": "Purchase",
  "required": ["_id", "customerId", "items"],
  "properties": {
    "_id": { "bsonType": "objectId" },
    "customerId": { "bsonType": "objectId" },
    "items": {
      "bsonType": "array",
      "items": {
        "bsonType": "object",
        "required": ["name", "quantity"],
        "properties": {
          "name": { "bsonType": "string" },
          "quantity": { "bsonType": "int" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Snippet Setup

To use a code snippet in a function, you must first instantiate a MongoDB collection handle:

```javascript
exports = function() {
  const mongodb = context.services.get("mongodb-atlas");
  const itemsCollection = mongodb.db("store").collection("items");
  const purchasesCollection = mongodb.db("store").collection("purchases");
  // ... paste snippet here ...
}
```

### Run an Aggregation Pipeline

You can execute an aggregation pipeline using the `collection.aggregate()` method. The following Function snippet groups all documents in the `purchases` collection by their `customerId` value and aggregates a count of the number of items each customer purchases as well as the total number of purchases that they made. After grouping the documents the pipeline adds a new field that calculates the average number of items each customer purchases at a time, `averageNumItemsPurchased`, to each customer's document:

```javascript
const pipeline = [
  { "$group": {
      "_id": "$customerId",
      "numPurchases": { "$sum": 1 },
      "numItemsPurchased": { "$sum": { "$size": "$items" } }
  } },
  { "$addFields": {
      "averageNumItemsPurchased": {
        "$divide": ["$numItemsPurchased", "$numPurchases"]
      }
  } }
]

return purchasesCollection.aggregate(pipeline).toArray()
  .then(customers => {
    console.log(`Successfully grouped purchases for ${customers.length} customers.`)
    for(const customer of customers) {
      console.log(`customer: ${customer._id}`)
      console.log(`num purchases: ${customer.numPurchases}`)
      console.log(`total items purchased: ${customer.numItemsPurchased}`)
      console.log(`average items per purchase: ${customer.averageNumItemsPurchased}`)
    }
    return customers
  })
  .catch(err => console.error(`Failed to group purchases by customer: ${err}`))
```

## Find Data with Atlas Search

You can run Atlas Search queries on a collection with `collection.aggregate()` and the `$search` aggregation stage.

> **Important:**
> Atlas Functions perform `$search` operations as a system user and enforce field-level rules on the returned search results. This means that a user may search on a field for which they do not have read access. In this case, the search is based on the specified field but no returned documents include the field.

**Input:**

```javascript
exports = async function searchMoviesAboutBaseball() {
  // 1. Get a reference to the collection you want to search.
  const movies = context.services
    .get("mongodb-atlas")
    .db("sample_mflix")
    .collection("movies");
  // 2. Run an aggregation with $search as the first stage.
  const baseballMovies = await movies
    .aggregate([
      {
        $search: {
          text: {
            query: "baseball",
            path: "plot",
          },
        },
      },
      {
        $limit: 5,
      },
      {
        $project: {
          _id: 0,
          title: 1,
          plot: 1,
        },
      },
    ])
    .toArray();
  return baseballMovies;
};
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "plot" : "A trio of guys try and make up for missed
  opportunities in childhood by forming a three-player
  baseball team to compete against standard children
  baseball squads.",
  "title" : "The Benchwarmers"
}
{
  "plot" : "A young boy is bequeathed the ownership of a
  professional baseball team.",
  "title" : "Little Big League"
}
{
  "plot" : "A trained chimpanzee plays third base for a
  minor-league baseball team.",
  "title" : "Ed"
}
{
  "plot" : "The story of the life and career of the famed
  baseball player, Lou Gehrig.",
  "title" : "The Pride of the Yankees"
}
{
  "plot" : "Babe Ruth becomes a baseball legend but is
  unheroic to those who know him.",
  "title" : "The Babe"
}
```

> **Note:**
> The [$$SEARCH_META](/atlas-search/query-syntax/#aggregation-variable) aggregation variable is only available for Functions that run as system or if the first role on the searched collection has its `apply_when` and `read` expressions set to `true`. If neither of these two scenarios apply, `$$SEARCH_META` is undefined and the aggregation will fail.

### Aggregation Stages
## Filter Documents

You can use the [$match](/reference/operator/aggregation/match/) stage to filter incoming documents using standard MongoDB [query syntax](/tutorial/query-documents).

```javascript
{
  "$match": {
    "<Field Name>": <Query Expression>,
    ...
  }
}
```

> **Example:**
> The following `$match` stage filters incoming documents to include only those where the `graduation_year` field has a value between `2019` and `2024`, inclusive.
>
> ```javascript
> {
>   "$match": {
>     "graduation_year": {
>       "$gte": 2019,
>       "$lte": 2024
>     },
>   }
> }
> ```
>

## Group Documents

You can use the [$group](/reference/operator/aggregation/group/) stage to aggregate summary data for groups of one or more documents. MongoDB groups documents based on the `_id` expression.

> **Note:**
> You can reference a specific document field by prefixing the field name with a `$`.

```javascript
{
  "$group": {
    "_id": <Group By Expression>,
    "<Field Name>": <Aggregation Expression>,
    ...
  }
}
```

> **Example:**
> The following `$group` stage groups documents by the value of their `customerId` field and calculates the number of purchase documents that each `customerId` appears in.
>
> ```javascript
> {
>   "$group": {
>     "_id": "$customerId",
>     "numPurchases": { "$sum": 1 }
>   }
> }
> ```
>

## Project Document Fields

You can use the [$project](/reference/operator/aggregation/project/) stage to include or omit specific fields from documents or to calculate new fields using [aggregation operators](/reference/operator/aggregation). To include a field, set its value to `1`. To omit a field, set its value to `0`.

> **Note:**
> You can't simultaneously omit and include fields other than `_id`. If you explicitly include a field other than `_id`, any fields you did not explicitly include are automatically omitted (and vice-versa).

```javascript
{
  "$project": {
    "<Field Name>": <0 | 1 | Expression>,
    ...
  }
}
```

> **Example:**
> The following `$project` stage omits the `_id` field, includes the `customerId` field, and creates a new field named `numItems` where the value is the number of documents in the `items` array:
>
> ```javascript
> {
>   "$project": {
>     "_id": 0,
>     "customerId": 1,
>     "numItems": { "$sum": { "$size": "$items" } }
>   }
> }
> ```
>

## Add Fields to Documents

You can use the [$addFields](/reference/operator/aggregation/addFields/) stage to add new fields with calculated values using [aggregation operators](/reference/operator/aggregation).

> **Note:**
> `$addFields` is similar to [$project](/reference/operator/aggregation/project/) but does not allow you to include or omit fields.

> **Example:**
> The following `$addFields` stages creates a new field named `numItems` where the value is the number of documents in the `items` array:
>
> ```javascript
> {
>   "$addFields": {
>     "numItems": { "$sum": { "$size": "$items" } }
>   }
> }
> ```
>

## Unwind Array Values

You can use the [$unwind](/reference/operator/aggregation/unwind/) stage to aggregate individual elements of array fields. When you unwind an array field, MongoDB copies each document once for each element of the array field but replaces the array value with the array element in each copy.

```javascript
{
  $unwind: {
    path: <Array Field Path>,
    includeArrayIndex: <string>,
    preserveNullAndEmptyArrays: <boolean>
  }
}
```

> **Example:**
> The following `$unwind` stage creates a new document for each element of the `items` array in each document. It also adds a field called `itemIndex` to each new document that specifies the element's position index in the original array:
>
> ```javascript
> {
>   "$unwind": {
>     "path": "$items",
>     "includeArrayIndex": "itemIndex"
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> Consider the following document from the `purchases` collection:
>
> ```javascript
> {
>   _id: 123,
>   customerId: 24601,
>   items: [
>     { name: "Baseball", quantity: 5 },
>     { name: "Baseball Mitt", quantity: 1 },
>     { name: "Baseball Bat", quantity: 1 },
>   ]
> }
> ```
>
> If we apply the example `$unwind` stage to this document, the stage outputs the following three documents:
>
> ```javascript
> {
>   _id: 123,
>   customerId: 24601,
>   itemIndex: 0,
>   items: { name: "Baseball", quantity: 5 }
> }, {
>   _id: 123,
>   customerId: 24601,
>   itemIndex: 1,
>   items: { name: "Baseball Mitt", quantity: 1 }
> }, {
>   _id: 123,
>   customerId: 24601,
>   itemIndex: 2,
>   items: { name: "Baseball Bat", quantity: 1 }
> }
> ```
>

### Aggregation Framework Limitations

## Aggregation Methods

Atlas Functions support aggregation on the both the database and collection level using the following commands:

- [db.aggregate()](/reference/method/db.aggregate)
- [db.collection.aggregate()](/reference/method/db.collection.aggregate)

## Aggregation Pipeline Stage Availability

All [aggregation pipeline stages](/reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/) stages are available to the *system user* except for `$indexStats`.

## Aggregation Pipeline Operator Availability

Atlas Functions support all [aggregation pipeline operators](/reference/operator/aggregation/) when you run an aggregation pipeline in the system user context.
