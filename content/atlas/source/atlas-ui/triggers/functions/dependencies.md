# External Dependencies

An **external dependency** is a library that includes code that you can't or don't want to implement yourself. For example, you might use an official library for an external service or a custom implementation of a data structure or algorithm. Atlas automatically transpiles dependencies and also supports most built-in Node.js modules.

> **Note:**
> Though most npm modules are written by third parties, you can also create and publish your own npm modules to house logic specific to your application. You can make your modules available to the Node.js community or reserve them for private use. For more information, check out npm's guide on [Contributing packages to the registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry).

## Add an External Package

To import and use an external dependency, you first need to add the dependency to your application. You can either add packages by name or upload a directory of dependencies.

> **Important:**
> You can only use one method at a time to specify the external packages your app can use. The most recent method that you used to specify dependencies is the source of truth and overrides previous specifications. For example, a package added by name through the UI overrides any copies of the same package that you've added previously, including those in an uploaded dependency directory.

### Add Packages by Name and Version

You can add packages from the npm registry to your app by name. You can either add a specific version or use the latest version.

1. In Atlas, go to the **Triggers** page for your project.

   1. If it's not already displayed, select the organization that contains your project from the *[icon: office]* **Organizations** menu in the navigation bar.
   2. If it's not already displayed, select your project from the **Projects** menu in the navigation bar.
   3. In the sidebar, click **Triggers** under the **Streaming Data** heading.

   The [Triggers](https://cloud.mongodb.com/go?l=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.mongodb.com%2Fv2%2F%3Cproject%3E%23%2Ftriggers) page displays.

1. **Navigate to Dependencies in the Atlas UI**

   1. Select the Trigger that you want to add the dependency to.
   2. On the **Edit Trigger** page, go to the **Function** section and click **Add Dependency**.

1. **Add Dependency Information**

   1. In the **Add Dependency** modal window, include the following information:

      | Field | Description |
      | --- | --- |
      | Define a Package Name | The name of the npm package. |
      | Package Version | Optional. Specific version of the dependency to use. By default, Atlas functions use the latest version available. |

   2. Click **Add** to add the package.

   You can track the status of adding the dependency in the progress tracker at the bottom of the window. The progress tracker provides a message letting you know if the package succeeded or failed. Failure messages contain additional information about why the package could not be added.

1. **Check Operation Success**

   When you successfully add the dependency, you'll see it on the list of dependencies in the **Dependencies** tab on the main **Triggers** page.

### Upload a Dependency Directory

You can upload a zipped `node_modules` directory of packages to your app. Zipped dependency directories may not exceed 15MB.

> **Important:**
> When you import an archive, any existing dependencies will be removed.

1. **Locally Install External Dependencies**

   To upload external dependencies, you first need a local `node_modules` folder containing at least one Node.js package. You can use the following code snippet to install a dependency locally you would like to upload:

   ```shell
   npm install <package name>
   ```

   If the `node_modules` folder does not already exist, this command automatically creates it.

   > **Note:**
   > You can also configure a `package.json` and run the `npm install` command to install all packages (and their dependencies) listed in your `package.json`. To learn more about npm and `node_modules`, consult the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install).

1. **Create a Dependency Archive**

   Now that you've downloaded all of your npm modules, you need to package them up in an archive so you can upload them to Atlas. Atlas supports `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`, and `.zip` archive formats. Create an archive containing the `node_modules` folder:

   ```shell
   tar -czf node_modules.tar.gz node_modules/
   ```

   After you create an archive containing your dependencies, you can upload your dependency archive using the Atlas UI.

1. In Atlas, go to the **Triggers** page for your project.

   1. If it's not already displayed, select the organization that contains your project from the *[icon: office]* **Organizations** menu in the navigation bar.
   2. If it's not already displayed, select your project from the **Projects** menu in the navigation bar.
   3. In the sidebar, click **Triggers** under the **Streaming Data** heading.

   The [Triggers](https://cloud.mongodb.com/go?l=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.mongodb.com%2Fv2%2F%3Cproject%3E%23%2Ftriggers) page displays.

1. **Upload the Dependency Archive**

   1. Select the **Dependencies** tab.
   2. Click **Upload Folder**.
   3. In the modal, click **Upload Folder**, then select the `node_modules.tar.gz` archive you just created.
   4. Click **Add**. Atlas uploads the archive file, which may take several minutes depending on the speed of your internet connection and the size of your dependency archive.
   5. Atlas displays a banner indicating the success or failure of the operation. If successful, the **Dependencies** tab displays a list of the dependencies that you included in your dependency archive.

      - If drafts are enabled, you must also click **Review & Deploy** to apply these changes.
      - If drafts are disabled, the change will take effect within 5 to 60 seconds, depending on the size of your dependency archive.

## Import a Package in a Function

You can import built-in modules and external packages that you've added to your app and then use them in your functions. To import a package, call `require()` with the package name from within the function body.

> **Important:**
> Node.js projects commonly place `require()` calls in the global scope of each file, but Atlas does not support this pattern. You *must* place `require()` calls within a function scope.

### Import a Full Module

```javascript
exports = () => {
   const R = require("ramda");
   return R.map(x => x*2, [1,2,3]);
}
```

### Import a Module Subfolder

```javascript
exports = function(arg){
   const cloneDeep = require("lodash/cloneDeep");

   var original = { name: "Deep" };
   var copy = cloneDeep(original);
   copy.name = "John";

   console.log(`original: ${original.name}`);
   console.log(`copy: ${copy.name}`);
   return (original != copy);
};
```
