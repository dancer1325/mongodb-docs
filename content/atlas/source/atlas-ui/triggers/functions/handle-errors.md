# Handle Errors in Functions

This page explains how to work with errors in Atlas Functions.

> **Note:**
> You can create a custom error handler specifically for database Triggers using AWS EventBridge. For more information, refer to Custom Error Handling.

You can handle Function errors using standard JavaScript error handling techniques like try...catch statements.

```js
function willThrowAndHandleError() {
  try {
    throw new Error("This will always happen");
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("An error occurred. Error message:" + err.message);
  }
}

exports = willThrowAndHandleError;
```

## View Logs

You can view records of all Function executions invoked by an Atlas Trigger on the **Logs** page. This includes Functions that failed to successfully execute due to an error. For more information, see atlas-logs.

## Retry Functions

Atlas Functions do not have built-in retry behavior. You can add custom retry behavior. For example, you might want to add retry behavior if the third-party service that your Function calls has intermittent connectivity, and you want the Function to re-execute even if the third-party service is temporarily down. The following sections describe the available strategies to add retry behavior to your Functions:

- Recursively Call Functions in Error Handling Blocks
- Use Database Triggers to Retry Functions

### Recursively Call Function in Error Handling Blocks

You can handle operations that might fail by calling a Function recursively. On a high level, this process includes the following components:

- Execute operations that you want to retry in a `try` statement and have the Function call itself in a `catch` statement.
- To prevent indefinite execution, set a maximum number of retries. Every time the Function fails and enters the `catch` statement, increment a count of the current number of retries. Stop the recursive execution when the Function's current number of retries reaches the max number of retries.
- You may also want to throttle retries to reduce the total number of executions in a time frame.

The following table describes some advantages and disadvantages of handling Function retries with the recursive call strategy.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
| - All retry logic occurs within one function. - Function can return a value after a retry. - Minimal additional code. | - All retries must occur within a single Function's max execution time. |

The following code example demonstrates an implementation of retrying a Function by using recursion in error-handling blocks:

**Recursive Call Strategy Example**

```js
// Utility function to suspend execution of current process
async function sleep(milliseconds) {
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, milliseconds));
}

// Set variables to be used by all calls to `mightFail`
// Tip: You could also store `MAX_RETRIES` and `THROTTLE_TIME_MS`
// in App Services Values
const MAX_RETRIES = 5;
const THROTTLE_TIME_MS = 5000;
let currentRetries = 0;
let errorMessage = "";

async function mightFail(...inputVars) {
  if (currentRetries === MAX_RETRIES) {
    console.error(
      `Reached maximum number of retries (${MAX_RETRIES}) without successful execution.`
    );
    console.error("Error Message:", errorMessage);
    return;
  }
  let res;
  try {
    // operation that might fail
    res = await callFlakyExternalService(...inputVars);
  } catch (err) {
    errorMessage = err.message;
    // throttle retries
    await sleep(THROTTLE_TIME_MS);
    currentRetries++;
    res = await mightFail(...inputVars);
  }
  return res;
}

exports = mightFail;
```

### Use Database Triggers to Retry

You can also retry Functions by using a Database Trigger to execute retries and a MongoDB collection to track previously-failed executions. On a high level, this process includes the following components:

- **Main Function** that executes the logic you want to retry, wrapped in the handler function.
- **Failed execution tracker MongoDB collection** that tracks failed executions of the main Function.
- **Handler Function** that invokes the main Function and logs when the function fails to the failed execution tracker collection.
- **Database Trigger Function** that reruns the handler function whenever the handler function adds an error to the failed execution tracker collection.

You can support multiple main functions with one set of a handler Function, execution tracker collection, and Database Trigger Function.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
| - Each retry is its own Function execution, with own max execution time and resources. | - If the Function is retried, it cannot return a value. - Each Function call requires two Function invocations, one for the Function itself and one for the retry handler. - More complex logic, which can be more difficult to write, debug, and monitor. |

You can create a retry mechanism for Functions in the Atlas UI or using the App Services CLI. The following procedure walks you through creating a handler, a retry Database Trigger Function, and a main Function.

1. **Create the Handler Function**

   First, create the handler Function `handleRetry` that invokes the main Function. `handleRetry` accepts the following parameters:

   | Parameter | Type | Description |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `functionToRetry` | JavaScript Function | Function to retry. |
   | `functionName` | String | Name of the function you want to retry. |
   | `operationId` | ObjectId | Unique identifier for the main function's execution, including retries. |
   | `previousRetries` | Number | How many times the main function has previously been tried. |
   | `...args` | Rest parameters | Indefinite number of arguments passed to the main function. |

   `handleRetry` performs the following operations:

   1. Attempts to execute `functionToRetry` in a `try` statement. If the execution is successful, `handleRetry` returns the value returned by `functionToRetry`.
   2. If the execution of `functionToRetry` in the previous step throws an error, the `catch` statement handles the error as follows:

      1. Checks if the number of previous retries equals the maximum permitted number of retries. If the two numbers are the same, then the function throws an error because the max retries has been reached. The function no longer attempts to retry.
      2. Build a function execution log entry object to insert into the database.
      3. Get a reference to the failed execution tracker collection.
      4. Insert the function log execution log entry into the failed execution tracker collection. This insertion operation causes the Database Trigger Function, which you will make in the next step, to fire.

   The main function is passed as the argument `functionToRetry`. `handleRetry` attempts to execute the main Function. If the execution fails, this function attempts to retry the main function.

   **Atlas UI**

   1. Navigate to **Functions**. Click the button **Create New Function**.
   2. In the field **Name**, add `handleRetry`.
   3. In the **Function Editor** add the following code, then save the Function:

      **handleRetry.js**

      ```js
      
      // Tip: You could also put this in an App Services Value
      const MAX_FUNC_RETRIES = 5;
      
      async function handleRetry(
        functionToRetry,
        functionName,
        operationId,
        previousRetries,
        ...args
      ) {
        try {
          // Try to execute the main function
          const response = await functionToRetry(...args);
          return response;
        } catch (err) {
          // Evaluates if should retry function again.
          // If no retry, throws error and stops retrying.
          if (previousRetries === MAX_FUNC_RETRIES) {
            throw new Error(
              `Maximum number of attempts reached (${MAX_FUNC_RETRIES}) for function '${functionName}': ${err.message}`
            );
          }
      
          // Build function execution log entry for insertion into database.
          const logEntry = {
            operationId,
            errorMessage: err.message,
            timestamp: new Date(),
            retries: previousRetries + 1,
            args,
            functionName,
          };
      
          // Get reference to database collection
          const executionLog = context.services
            .get("mongodb-atlas")
            .db("logs")
            .collection("failed_execution_logs");
      
          // Add execution log entry to database
          await executionLog.insertOne(logEntry);
          return;
        }
      }
      
      exports = handleRetry;
      ```

   ---

   **App Services CLI**

   1. Add the following to functions/config.json:

      ```js
      [
        {
          "name": "handleRetry",
          "private": true,
          "run_as_system": true
        }
        // ...other configuration
      ]
      ```

   2. Create the file for the Function functions/handleRetry.js:

      **functions/handleRetry.js**

      ```js
      
      // Tip: You could also put this in an App Services Value
      const MAX_FUNC_RETRIES = 5;
      
      async function handleRetry(
        functionToRetry,
        functionName,
        operationId,
        previousRetries,
        ...args
      ) {
        try {
          // Try to execute the main function
          const response = await functionToRetry(...args);
          return response;
        } catch (err) {
          // Evaluates if should retry function again.
          // If no retry, throws error and stops retrying.
          if (previousRetries === MAX_FUNC_RETRIES) {
            throw new Error(
              `Maximum number of attempts reached (${MAX_FUNC_RETRIES}) for function '${functionName}': ${err.message}`
            );
          }
      
          // Build function execution log entry for insertion into database.
          const logEntry = {
            operationId,
            errorMessage: err.message,
            timestamp: new Date(),
            retries: previousRetries + 1,
            args,
            functionName,
          };
      
          // Get reference to database collection
          const executionLog = context.services
            .get("mongodb-atlas")
            .db("logs")
            .collection("failed_execution_logs");
      
          // Add execution log entry to database
          await executionLog.insertOne(logEntry);
          return;
        }
      }
      
      exports = handleRetry;
      ```

   3. Deploy your changes:

      Run the following command to deploy your changes:

      ```shell
      appservices push
      ```

1. **Create the Retry Database Trigger**

   **Atlas UI**

   1.

      In Atlas, go to the **Triggers** page.

      1. If it's not already displayed, select the organization that contains your project from the *[icon: office]* **Organizations** menu in the navigation bar.
      2. If it's not already displayed, select your project from the **Projects** menu in the navigation bar.
      3. In the sidebar, click **Triggers** under the **Streaming Data** heading.

      The [Triggers](https://cloud.mongodb.com/go?l=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.mongodb.com%2Fv2%2F%3Cproject%3E%23%2Ftriggers) page displays.

   2. Click **Add a Trigger**.
   3. Create the Trigger with the following configuration:

      | Field | Value |
      | --- | --- |
      | Name | Name of your choosing (ex: `retryOperation`) |
      | Enabled | Yes |
      | Skip Events on Re-Enable | Yes |
      | Event Ordering | Yes |
      | Cluster Name | Name of your choosing (ex: `mongodb-atlas`) |
      | Database Name | Name of your choosing (ex: `logs`) |
      | Collection Name | Name of your choosing (ex: `failed_execution_logs`) |
      | Operation Type | Insert |
      | Full Document | Yes |
      | Document Preimage | No |
      | Select An Event Type | Function |
      | Function | Click **+ New Function**. Refer to the following information about the contents of the function. |
      | Advanced Configuration | N/A - No advanced configuration necessary. |

   4. Now add the code to the Function that the Trigger invokes. The function `retryOperation` takes as a parameter `logEntry`, the document that the retry handler posted to the failed execution tracker collection. Then, `retryOperation` uses context.functions.execute() to invoke the main function with information from `logEntry`.

      1. In the field **Function Name**, add `retryOperationDbTrigger`.
      2. For the field **Function**, add the following code, then save the Trigger:

         **functions/retryOperationDbTrigger.js**

         ```js
         async function retryOperation({ fullDocument: logEntry }) {
           // parse values from log entry posted to database
           const { args, retries, functionName, operationId } = logEntry;
           // Re-execute the main function
           await context.functions.execute(functionName, ...args, operationId, retries);
         }
         
         exports = retryOperation;
         ```

   ---

   **App Services CLI**

   1. Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas user:

      Use your MongoDB Atlas Administration API Key to log in to the App Services CLI:

      ```shell
      appservices login --api-key="<API KEY>" --private-api-key="<PRIVATE KEY>"
      ```

   2. Pull your App's latest configuration files:

      Run the following command to get a local copy of your configuration files:

      ```shell
      appservices pull --remote=<App ID>
      ```

      By default, the command pulls files into the current working directory. You can specify a directory path with the optional `--local` flag.

   3. Add configuration for the Database Trigger. For more information, refer to the Trigger configuration reference.

      **triggers/retryOperation.json**

      ```json
      {
        "name": "retry",
        "type": "DATABASE",
        "config": {
          "operation_types": ["INSERT"],
          "database": "logs",
          "collection": "failed_execution_logs",
          "service_name": "mongodb-atlas",
          "project": {},
          "full_document": true,
          "full_document_before_change": false,
          "unordered": false,
          "skip_catchup_events": false
        },
        "disabled": false,
        "event_processors": {
          "FUNCTION": {
            "config": {
              "function_name": "retryOperationDbTrigger"
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```

   4. Now add the code to the functions/config.json Function that the Trigger invokes. The function `retryOperation` takes as a parameter `logEntry`, the document that the retry handler posted to the failed execution tracker collection. Then, `retryOperation` uses context.functions.execute() to invoke the main function with information from `logEntry`.

      ```js
      [
        // ...other configuration
        {
          "name": "retryOperationDbTrigger",
          "private": true
        }
      ]
      ```

   5. Add the following code to the file functions/retryOperationDbTrigger.js:

      **retryOperationDbTrigger.js**

      ```js
      async function retryOperation({ fullDocument: logEntry }) {
        // parse values from log entry posted to database
        const { args, retries, functionName, operationId } = logEntry;
        // Re-execute the main function
        await context.functions.execute(functionName, ...args, operationId, retries);
      }
      
      exports = retryOperation;
      ```

   6. Deploy your changes:

      Run the following command to deploy your changes:

      ```shell
      appservices push
      ```

   ---

1. **Create the Main Function**

   Now that you have the function handler and the retry Database Trigger Function, you can write the main function. In the following example, the Function randomly throws an error when performing addition. The JavaScript functions that execute this logic are the following:

   - `getRandomOneTwoThree()`: Helper function for generating errors for the example.
   - `additionOrFailure()`: Function with the main logic.

   The invocation of `additionOrFailure()` wrapped by the retry handler occurs in the exported function `additionWithRetryHandler()`. *All* functions that use the retry handler function should resemble this function. You must include the correct parameters to make this function work with the rest of the retry logic. These parameters are:

   | Parameter | Type | Description |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `...args` | Rest parameters | Zero or more parameters to pass to the function with main logic. In the case of this example, the two numbers added in `additionOrFailure()`, `num1` and `num2`. |
   | `operationId` | BSON.Object.Id | Unique identifier for the Function call and retries. Set default value to a `new BSON.ObjectId()`. |
   | `retries` | Number | Set default value to 0. |

   The body of `additionWithRetryHandler` is the retry handler `handleRetry` invoked by `context.functions.execute()`, which in turn invokes `additionOrFailure`. The arguments you pass to `context.functions.execute()` are the following:

   | Argument | Type | Description |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `"handleRetry"` | String | Name of the Function you defined to invoke the main function and post to the retry logs if the main function doesn't properly execute. |
   | `additionOrFailure` | JavaScript function | The main function that `handleRetry()` invokes. |
   | `operationId` | BSON.ObjectId | Passed in as argument from the parameter `operationId` of `additionWithRetryHandler()`. |
   | `retries` | Number | Passed in as argument from the parameter `retries` of `additionWithRetryHandler()`. |
   | `...args` | Spread arguments | Zero or more arguments to pass to the function with main logic. Passed in as argument from the parameter `...args` of `additionWithRetryHandler()` |

   **Atlas UI**

   1. In the field **Function Name**, add `additionWithRetryHandler`.
   2. For the field **Function**, add the following code:

      **additionWithRetryHandler.js**

      ```js
      // randomly generates 1, 2, or 3
      function getRandomOneTwoThree() {
        return Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 1;
      }
      
      function additionOrFailure(num1, num2) {
        // Throw error if getRandomOneTwoThree returns 1
        const rand = getRandomOneTwoThree();
        if (rand === 1) throw new Error("Uh oh!!");
        const sum = num1 + num2;
        console.log(`Successful addition of ${num1} + ${num2}. Result: ${sum}`);
      
        // Otherwise return the sum
        return sum;
      }
      
      async function additionWithRetryHandler(
        inputVar1,
        inputVar2,
        // create a new `operation_id` if one not provided
        operationId = new BSON.ObjectId(),
        // count number of attempts
        retries = 0
      ) {
        const res = await context.functions.execute(
          "handleRetry",
          additionOrFailure,
          "additionWithRetryHandler", // MUST BE NAME OF FUNCTION
          operationId,
          retries,
          inputVar1,
          inputVar2
        );
        return res;
      }
      
      exports = additionWithRetryHandler;
      ```

   3. Click **Save**.
   ---

   **App Services CLI**

   1. Add the Function metadata to functions/config.json:

      ```js
      [
          // ...other configuration
          {
            "name": "additionWithRetryHandler",
            "private": false
          }
      ]
      ```

   2. Add the following code to the file functions/additionWithRetryHandler.js:

      **functions/additionWithRetryHandler.js**

      ```js
      // randomly generates 1, 2, or 3
      function getRandomOneTwoThree() {
        return Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 1;
      }
      
      function additionOrFailure(num1, num2) {
        // Throw error if getRandomOneTwoThree returns 1
        const rand = getRandomOneTwoThree();
        if (rand === 1) throw new Error("Uh oh!!");
        const sum = num1 + num2;
        console.log(`Successful addition of ${num1} + ${num2}. Result: ${sum}`);
      
        // Otherwise return the sum
        return sum;
      }
      
      async function additionWithRetryHandler(
        inputVar1,
        inputVar2,
        // create a new `operation_id` if one not provided
        operationId = new BSON.ObjectId(),
        // count number of attempts
        retries = 0
      ) {
        const res = await context.functions.execute(
          "handleRetry",
          additionOrFailure,
          "additionWithRetryHandler", // MUST BE NAME OF FUNCTION
          operationId,
          retries,
          inputVar1,
          inputVar2
        );
        return res;
      }
      
      exports = additionWithRetryHandler;
      ```

   3. Deploy your changes:

      Run the following command to deploy your changes:

      ```shell
      appservices push
      ```

   ---

   Now when you invoke `additionWithRetryHandler`, the Function will retry if it fails.
