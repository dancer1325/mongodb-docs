# Trigger Logs

Atlas keeps a log of Trigger, Function, and Change Stream events and publishes notifications to your Atlas project's activity feed. Atlas saves logs for 10 days, after which they are deleted. To learn how to view, filter, and analyze your application logs, see View Application Logs.

## Error Logs

All log entries have one of the following statuses:

- `OK`, which represents a normal event that succeeded without an error.
- `Error`, which represents an event that did not run successfully for any reason.

For example, Atlas logs an error for any of the following events:

- You attempt to access data stored in Atlas for which there is no applicable rule.
- You throw or fail to handle an error or promise rejection in an Atlas Function.
- You call `context.services.get()` for a service which does not exist.

## Log Filters

For performance reasons, Atlas limits individual queries to a maximum of 100 log entries per page. You can filter entries by type, status, timestamp, user, and request ID to return only logs that are relevant to your query.

## Log Lines

Functions can log information using JavaScript's `console.log()` method. Atlas stringifies each console log and stores each string as a single line. Atlas truncates lines to 512 bytes in length. For ASCII character sets, this translates to 512 characters; depending on the character set you use, you may see truncation at lower character counts. Atlas saves only the first 25 log lines for a given log entry.

## Log Retention

Atlas retains logs for 10 days, after which they are deleted. If you require logs older than 10 days, you can automatically forward logs to another service. You can also download a dump of currently available logs from the UI or use the Admin API Logging endpoints to fetch logs before they expire.

## App Metrics

Atlas measures usage and records aggregate metrics over time. You can access and use the metrics to assess performance and identify usage trends. For example, how much time was spent performing computations. To learn more about which metrics are available and how to access them, see Metrics.

## Atlas Alerts

Atlas events publish to your Atlas project's activity feed. Alerts include Trigger failure events, which occur when a Trigger fails and cannot restart automatically. To learn more, see Activity Feed & Atlas Alerts.

## Log Format

Trigger log entries have the following form:

```javascript
Logs:
[
   <log line>,
   <log line>,
   ...
]

 See Function. See Trigger.

 Compute Used: <number> bytes•ms
```

## Fields

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Compute Used | Computational load of the operation. |
| Logs | List of `console.log` outputs. Atlas saves the first 512 bytes of the last 25 `console.log()` calls. |
| See Function. See Trigger. | Links to the Trigger that launched this event as well as the Function that was run by this event. |

## Error Fields

Log entries created by unsuccessful operations may feature the following additional fields for debugging purposes:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Error | Brief description of an error. |
