# `mongosh` Help

This document provides an overview of the help available in
`mongosh`.

> **Tip**
>
> When accessing help in `mongosh`, you can use the `.help()` and
> `.help` syntaxes interchangeably.

## Command Line Help

To see the options for running the `mongosh` executable and
connecting to a deployment, use the `--help`
option from the command line:

```bash
mongosh --help

```

## `mongosh` Shell Help

To see the list of commands available in the `mongosh` console,
type `help` inside a running `mongosh` console:

```javascript
help

```

## Database Help

You can view database level information from inside the
`mongosh` console:

By default `mongosh` shows the current database in the prompt.
You can also see the current database by running the `db` command:

```javascript
db

```

### Show Available Databases

To see the list of databases available to you on the server, use the
`show dbs` command:

```javascript
show dbs

```

`show databases` is an alias for `show dbs`.

> **Tip**
>
> The list of databases will change depending on your access
> authorizations. For more information on access restrictions for
> viewing databases, see `listDatabases`.

### Show Database Methods

To see the list of \[database methods\](<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/js-database/>) you can use on the `db` object, run
\`db.help()\`:

```javascript
db.help()

```

The output resembles the following abbreviated list:

```none
Database Class:

  getMongo                      Returns the current database connection
  getName                       Returns the name of the DB
  getCollectionNames            Returns an array containing the names of all collections in the current database.
  getCollectionInfos            Returns an array of documents with collection information, i.e. collection name and options, for the current database.
  runCommand                    Runs an arbitrary command on the database.
  adminCommand                  Runs an arbitrary command against the admin database.
  ...

```

### Show Help for a Specific Database Method

To see help for a specific database method in `mongosh`, type the
`db.<method name>`, followed by `.help` or `.help()`. The
following example returns help for the `db.adminCommand()`
method:

```javascript
db.adminCommand.help()

```

The output resembles the following:

```javascript
db.adminCommand({ serverStatus: 1 }):

Runs an arbitrary command against the admin database.

For more information on usage: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.adminCommand

```

### Show Additional Usage Details for a Database Method

To see additional usage details for a database method in `mongosh`,
type the `db.<method name>` without the parenthesis (`()`). The
following example returns details about the
`db.adminCommand()` method:

```javascript
db.adminCommand

```

The output resembles the following:

```javascript
[Function: adminCommand] AsyncFunction {
  apiVersions: [ 1, Infinity ],
  serverVersions: [ '3.4.0', '999.999.999' ],
  returnsPromise: true,
  topologies: [ 'ReplSet', 'Sharded', 'LoadBalanced', 'Standalone' ],
  returnType: { type: 'unknown', attributes: {} },
  deprecated: false,
  platforms: [ 0, 1, 2 ],
  isDirectShellCommand: false,
  acceptsRawInput: false,
  shellCommandCompleter: undefined,
  help: [Function (anonymous)] Help
}

```

## Collection Help

You can view collection level information from inside the
`mongosh` console.

These help methods accept a collection name, `<collection>`, but you
can also use the generic term, "collection", or even a collection that
does not exist.

### List Collections in the Current Database

To see the list of collections in the current database, use the
`show collections` command:

```javascript
show collections

```

The `show collections` output indicates if a collection is a
time series collection or a
read-only view.

```javascript
managementFeedback          [view]
survey
weather                     [time-series]
system.buckets.weather
system.views

```

In the preceding example:

- `managementFeedback` is a view
- `weather` is a time series
- `survey` is a collection
- `system.buckets.weather` is a system generated collection
  that supports the `weather` time series
- `system.views` is a system generated collection that supports
  views on other collections

### Show Collection Methods

To see the list of methods available on collection objects use the
`db.<collection>.help()` method:

```javascript
db.collection.help()

```

`<collection>` can be the name of an existing or non-existent
collection.

The output resembles the following abbreviated list:

```none
Collection Class:

  aggregate          Calculates aggregate values for the data in a collection or a view.
  bulkWrite          Performs multiple write operations with controls for order of execution.
  count              Returns the count of documents that would match a find() query for the collection or view.
  countDocuments     Returns the count of documents that match the query for a collection or view.
  deleteMany         Removes all documents that match the filter from a collection.
  deleteOne          Removes a single document from a collection.
  ...

```

### Show Help for a Specific Collection Method

To see help for a specific collection method in `mongosh`, use
`db.<collection>.<method name>`, followed by `.help` or
`.help()`.

The following example displays help for \`db.collection.insertOne()\`:

```javascript
db.collection.insertOne.help()

```

The output resembles the following:

```none
db.collection.insertOne(document, options):

Inserts a document into a collection.

For more information on usage: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.insertOne

```

### Show Additional Details for a Collection Method

To see additional details for a collection method type the method name,
`db.<collection>.<method>`, without the parenthesis (`()`).

The following example returns details about the
`insertOne()` method:

```javascript
db.collection.insertOne

```

The output resembles the following:

```javascript
[Function: insertOne] AsyncFunction {
  apiVersions: [ 1, Infinity ],
  serverVersions: [ '3.2.0', '999.999.999' ],
  returnsPromise: true,
  topologies: [ 'ReplSet', 'Sharded', 'LoadBalanced', 'Standalone' ],
  returnType: { type: 'unknown', attributes: {} },
  deprecated: false,
  platforms: [ 0, 1, 2 ],
  isDirectShellCommand: false,
  acceptsRawInput: false,
  shellCommandCompleter: undefined,
  help: [Function (anonymous)] Help
}

```

## Cursor Help

To modify read operations that use
`find()`, use cursor methods.

To list the available modifier and cursor handling methods, use the
`db.collection.find().help()` command:

```javascript
db.collection.find().help()

```

This help call accepts a collection name, `<collection>`, but you
can also use the generic term, "collection", or even a collection which
does not exist.

Some useful methods for handling cursors are:

- `hasNext()` checks if the cursor has more documents.
- `next()` returns the next document and moves the
  cursor position forward by one.
- `forEach(\<function\>)` applies the
  `<function>` to each document returned by the cursor.

For a list of available cursor methods, see js-query-cursor-methods.

## BSON Class Help

`mongosh` provides help methods for BSON classes. The
help methods provide a brief overview of the BSON class and a link with
more information.

To access help for BSON classes, run `.help()` on either the class
name or an instantiated instance of the class:

```none
<BSON class>.help()
// or
<BSON class>().help()

```

For example, to view help for the `ObjectId` BSON class, run one of
the following commands:

```javascript
ObjectId.help()

```

```javascript
ObjectId().help()

```

`mongosh` returns the same output for both `.help()` methods:

```javascript
The ObjectId BSON Class:

For more information on usage: https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6/api/ObjectID.html

```

`mongosh` provides help methods for the following BSON classes:

- `BinData`
- `Code`
- `DBRef`
- `MinKey`
- `MaxKey`
- `NumberDecimal`
- `NumberInt`
- `NumberLong`
- `ObjectId`
- `Symbol` *(Deprecated)*
- `Timestamp`

## Log Method Help

`mongosh` provides help for log message
methods. To see available log message methods, run the following
command:

```javascript
log.help()

```
