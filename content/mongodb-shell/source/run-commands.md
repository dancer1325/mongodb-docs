# Run Commands

To run commands in `mongosh`, you must first
connect to a MongoDB deployment.

## Format Input and Output

`mongosh` uses the \[Node.js BSON parser\](<https://www.npmjs.com/package/bson>) parser to parse \[BSON\](<https://www.mongodb.com/basics/bson>)
data. You can use the parser's \[EJSON\](<https://www.npmjs.com/package/bson#EJSON>) interface to transform your
data when you work with `mongosh`.

For examples that use EJSON, see: mongosh-ejson.

## Switch Databases

To display the database you are using, type `db`:

```sh
db

```

The operation should return `test`, which is the default database.

To switch databases, issue the `use <db>` helper, as in the
following example:

```javascript
use <database>

```

To access a different database from the current database without
switching your current database context, see the
`db.getSiblingDB()` method.

To list the databases available to the user, use the helper `show dbs`.

### Create a New Database and Collection

To create a new database, issue the `use <db>` command with the
database that you would like to create. For example, the following
commands create both the database `myNewDatabase` and the
collection `myCollection` using the
`insertOne()` operation:

```javascript
use myNewDatabase
db.myCollection.insertOne( { x: 1 } );

```

If a collection does not exist, MongoDB creates the collection when you
first store data for that collection.

## Terminate a Running Command

To terminate a running command or query in `mongosh`,
press `Ctrl + C`.

When you enter `Ctrl + C`, \`mongosh\`:

- interrupts the active command,
- tries to terminate the ongoing, server-side operation, and
- returns a command prompt.

If `mongosh` cannot cleanly terminate the running process,
it issues a warning.

> **Note**
>
> Pressing `Ctrl + C` in `mongosh` does not terminate
> asynchronous code. Asynchronous operations such as `setTimeout` or
> operations like `fs.readFile` continue to run.
>
> There is no way to terminate asynchronous code in
> `mongosh`. This is the same behavior as in the Node.js
> [REPL](https://nodejs.org/api/repl.html).

Pressing `Ctrl + C` once will not exit `mongosh`, press
`Ctrl + C` twice to exit `mongosh`.

You can also terminate a script from within the script code by calling the
`exit(<code>)` command. For more information, refer to
Terminate a Script on Error.

## Command Exceptions

## Clear the `mongosh` Console

The `cls` command clears the console. You can also clear the console
with `Ctrl + L` and `console.clear()`.
