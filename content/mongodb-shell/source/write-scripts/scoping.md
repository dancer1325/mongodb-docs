# Code Scoping

When JavaScript is loaded into `mongosh`, top-level
functions and variables defined with `const`, `var`, and `let`
are added to the global scope.

Consider the following code:

```javascript
const SNIPPET_VERSION = "4.3.2";
var loadedFlag = true;
let unloaded = false;

function isSnippetLoaded(loadedFlag) {
   return ( loadedFlag ? "Snippet is loaded" : "Snippet is not loaded" )
}

```

The variables, `SNIPPET_VERSION`, `loadedFlag`, and `unloaded`
are added to the global scope along with the function,
`isSnippetLoaded()`.

To avoid collisions with functions and variables defined in other code,
be sure to consider scope as you write scripts. As a best practice,
MongoDB recommends wrapping your code to limit scope. This guards
against accidental scope collisions with similarly named elements in
the global scope.

One way to keep functions and variables out of global scope is to wrap
your code like this:

```javascript
'use strict';
(() => {
   ...
})()

```

> **Tip**
>
> `use strict;` is for use in scripts. If you enter `use strict;`
> in the `mongosh` console directly,
> `mongosh` will switch to a database called `strict`.

## Example: Restricting Scope

Compare the following code samples. They are very similar, but the
second one is written in a way that restricts variable scope.

Sample 1: Unrestricted scope.

```javascript
let averageGrossSales = [ 10000, 15000, 9000, 22000 ];

const Q1_DISCOUNT = .10;
const Q2_DISCOUNT = .15;
const Q3_DISCOUNT = .06;
const Q4_DISCOUNT = .23;

function quarterlySales(grossAmount, discount ) {
   return grossAmount * discount ;
}

function yearlySales() {
   let annualTotal = 0;

   annualTotal += quarterlySales(averageGrossSales[0], Q1_DISCOUNT );
   annualTotal += quarterlySales(averageGrossSales[1], Q2_DISCOUNT );
   annualTotal += quarterlySales(averageGrossSales[2], Q3_DISCOUNT );
   annualTotal += quarterlySales(averageGrossSales[3], Q4_DISCOUNT );

   return annualTotal ;
}

```

Sample 2: Restricted scope.

```javascript
(() => {

   let averageGrossSales = [ 10000, 15000, 9000, 22000 ];

   const Q1_DISCOUNT = .10;
   const Q2_DISCOUNT = .15;
   const Q3_DISCOUNT = .06;
   const Q4_DISCOUNT = .23;

   function quarterlySales(grossAmount, discount ) {
      return grossAmount * discount ;
   }

   globalThis.exposedYearlySales = function yearlySales() {
      let annualTotal = 0;

      annualTotal += quarterlySales(averageGrossSales[0], Q1_DISCOUNT );
      annualTotal += quarterlySales(averageGrossSales[1], Q2_DISCOUNT );
      annualTotal += quarterlySales(averageGrossSales[2], Q3_DISCOUNT );
      annualTotal += quarterlySales(averageGrossSales[3], Q4_DISCOUNT );

      return annualTotal ;
   }
} )()

```

In Sample 2, the following elements are all scoped within an anonymous
function and they are all excluded from the global scope:

- The main function, `yearlySales()`
- The helper function, `quarterlySales()`
- The variables

The `globalThis.exposedYearlySales = function yearlySales()`
assignment statement adds `exposedYearlySales` to the global scope.

When you, call `exposedYearlySales()` it calls the `yearlySales()`
function. The `yearlySales()` function is not directly accessible.
