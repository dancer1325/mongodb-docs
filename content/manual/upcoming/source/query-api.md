# MongoDB Query API

The MongoDB Query API is the mechanism that you use to interact with
your data.

The Query API comprises two ways to query data in MongoDB:

- CRUD Operations
- Aggregation pipelines

You can use the Query API to perform:

- **Adhoc queries**. Explore your MongoDB data with `mongosh`,
  Compass ,
  [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/azure/mongodb)
  or a MongoDB `driver`.
- **Data transformations**. Use
  aggregation pipelines to
  reshape your data and perform calculations.
- **Document join support** Use `\$lookup` and
  `\$unionWith` to combine data from different collections.
- **Graph and geospatial queries**. Use operators such as
  `\$geoWithin` and `\$geoNear` to analyze geospatial
  data and `\$graphLookup` for graph data.
- **Full-text search**. Use the `\$search` stage to
  perform efficient text search on your data.
- **Semantic search**. Use the `\$vectorSearch` stage to
  perform semantic search on your data.
- **Indexing**. Improve your MongoDB query performance by using the correct
  index type for your data architecture.
- **On-demand materialized views**. Use `\$out` and
  `\$merge` to create materialized views
  on common queries.
- **Time series analysis**. Query and aggregate your time-stamped data
  with time series collections.

## Document Model

A document in MongoDB is a data structure composed of field and value
pairs. Documents are stored as BSON which is the binary representation of
JSON. This low level of abstraction helps you develop quicker
and reduces the efforts around querying and data modeling. The document
model provides several advantages, including:

- Documents correspond to native data types in many programming
  languages.
- Embedded documents and arrays reduce need for expensive joins.
- Flexible schema. Documents do not need to have the same set of fields
  and the data type for a field can differ across documents within a
  collection.

## Data as Code

The MongoDB Query API supports `drivers` for major
programming languages. These drivers allow you to make calls to the
database and generate queries using the syntax native to your
application.

Query API.
