# Network and Configuration Hardening for Self-Managed Deployments

To reduce the risk exposure of the entire MongoDB system, ensure that
only trusted hosts have access to MongoDB.

## MongoDB Configuration Hardening

### IP Binding

> **Warning**
>
> Make sure that your `mongod` and `mongos`
> instances are only accessible on trusted networks. If your system
> has more than one network interface, bind MongoDB programs to the
> private or internal network interface.

## Network Hardening

### Firewalls

Firewalls allow administrators to filter and control access to a system
by providing granular control over network communications. For
administrators of MongoDB, the following capabilities are important:
limiting incoming traffic on a specific port to specific systems and
limiting incoming traffic from untrusted hosts.

On Linux systems, the `iptables` interface provides access to the
underlying `netfilter` firewall. On Windows systems, `netsh`
command line interface provides access to the underlying Windows
Firewall. For additional information about firewall configuration, see:

- /tutorial/configure-linux-iptables-firewall and
- /tutorial/configure-windows-netsh-firewall.

For best results and to minimize overall exposure, ensure that *only*
traffic from trusted sources can reach `mongod` and
`mongos` instances and that the `mongod` and
`mongos` instances can only connect to trusted outputs.

### Virtual Private Networks

Virtual private networks, or VPNs, make it possible to link two
networks over an encrypted and limited-access trusted
network. Typically, MongoDB users who use VPNs use TLS/SSL rather than
IPSEC VPNs for performance issues.

Depending on configuration and implementation, VPNs provide for
certificate validation and a choice of encryption protocols, which
requires a rigorous level of authentication and identification of all
clients. Furthermore, because VPNs provide a secure tunnel, by using a
VPN connection to control access to your MongoDB instance, you can
prevent tampering and "man-in-the-middle" attacks.

### Disable IP Forwarding

IP forwarding allows servers to forward packets to other systems. Disable this
feature on servers that host `mongod`.

To disable IP forwarding on Linux, use the `sysctl` command:

```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=0

```

To make the change persistent, edit the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file to add
this line:

```conf
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0
```

IP forwarding is disabled by default on Windows.
