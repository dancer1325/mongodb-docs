# Scaling Strategies

Database scaling is a fundamental challenge for growing applications.
Whether you start a new application or experience growth, there are
two main scaling strategies:

- Vertical scaling – Upgrade a single server with additional resources.
- Horizontal scaling – Distribute the workload across multiple servers.

While vertical scaling can provide immediate relief to resource allocation,
horizontal scaling is a more sustainable and flexible approach when scale is
a factor.

As applications grow, traditional database scaling forces difficult trade-offs
between performance, complexity, and cost. MongoDB supports horizontal scaling
through its sharding architecture, which distributes data and
workloads across multiple servers known as shards. If
you’re building for scale, it’s crucial to consider sharding proactively to
ensure seamless growth.

MongoDB's sharded cluster architecture offers several strategies to scale your
database:

- Start early with a sharded cluster, even with a single shard, to future-proof
  your application.
- Move unsharded collections between shards to isolate workloads, support
  multi-tenant architectures, comply with geographic requirements, optimize
  costs, and reduce collection density.
- Shard specific collections when they approach resource limits or grow beyond
  3 TB in storage size.
- Unshard collections when application patterns change and the benefits of a
  sharded collection no longer outweigh the costs.

You can use these flexible scaling capabilities to optimize performance and
control costs, while maintaining a single connection point for your
applications.

## Strategies for Horizontal Scaling

In a sharded cluster, each shard is a replica set. Multiple shards function
as a part of the same cluster. Your application accesses all resources
transparently by connecting to mongos, which handles the
complexity of routing requests to the right place.

There are two primary methods to distribute workloads in a sharded cluster:

- Moving collections onto dedicated shards – Assign entire collections to
  specific shards, optimizing performance by distributing workloads
  strategically.
- Partitioning a collection across multiple shards – Split a single collection
  across multiple shards using a shard key,
  distributing data more evenly for scalability.

These approaches can be used independently or combined, depending on your
requirements.
