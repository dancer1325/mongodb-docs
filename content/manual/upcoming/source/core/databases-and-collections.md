# Databases and Collections in MongoDB

## Overview

MongoDB stores data records as documents
(specifically BSON documents) which are
gathered together in collections. A
database stores one or more collections of documents.

You can manage databases and
collections on the Atlas cluster from
the Atlas UI, `mongosh`, or [\|compass\|](##SUBST##|compass|). This page describes
how to manage databases and collections on the Atlas cluster from the
Atlas UI. For self-managed deployments, you can use
`mongosh` or [\|compass\|](##SUBST##|compass|) to manage databases and collections.

Select the client that you want to use to manage databases and
collections.

MongoDB Atlas is a multi-cloud database service that simplifies
deploying and managing your databases on the cloud providers of
your choice.
The MongoDB Shell, `mongosh`, is a JavaScript and Node.js
REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) environment for interacting
with MongoDB deployments. To learn more, see `mongosh`.
MongoDB Compass is a powerful GUI for querying, aggregating, and
analyzing your MongoDB data in a visual environment. To learn
more, see MongoDB Compass.
Databases
---------

In MongoDB, databases hold one or more collections of documents.

To select a database to use, log in to Atlas and do the following:

**Navigate to the Collections tab.**

**Select the database from the list of databases in the left pane.**

To select a database to use, in `mongosh`, issue the
`use <db>` statement, as in the following example:

```javascript
use myDB
```

To select a database to use, complete the following steps:

**Start \|compass\| and connect to your cluster.**

To learn more, see Connect to MongoDB.

**Select Databases from the left navigation.**

The Databases tab opens to list the existing databases
for your MongoDB deployment.
Create a Database
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~~

To create a new database, log in to Atlas and do the following:

**Navigate to the Collections tab.**

**Click Create Database.**

**Enter the Database Name and the Collection Name.**

Enter the database and the collection name to create the
database and its first collection.

**Click Create.**

Upon successful creation, the database and the collection
displays in the left pane in the Atlas UI.
If a database does not exist, MongoDB creates the database when you
first store data for that database. As such, you can switch to a
non-existent database and perform the following operation in
\`mongosh\`:

```javascript
use myNewDB

db.myNewCollection1.insertOne( { x: 1 } )

```

The `insertOne()` operation creates both the
database `myNewDB` and the collection `myNewCollection1` if they do
not already exist. Be sure that both the database and collection names
follow MongoDB restrictions-on-db-names.

**Open the Databases tab.**

**Click the Create database button.**

**Enter database and first collection names in the Create Database dialog.**

**Click Create Database to create the database and its first collection.**

## Collections

MongoDB stores documents in collections. Collections are analogous to
tables in relational databases.

### Create a Collection

If a collection does not exist, MongoDB creates the collection when you
first store data for that collection.

To create a new collection, log in to Atlas and do the following:

**Navigate to the Collections tab.**

**Click the + icon for the database.**

**Enter the name of the collection.**

**Click Create.**

Upon successful creation, the collection displays underneath
the database in the Atlas UI.

```javascript
db.myNewCollection2.insertOne( { x: 1 } )
db.myNewCollection3.createIndex( { y: 1 } )

```

Both the `insertOne()` and the
`createIndex()` operations create their
respective collection if they do not already exist. Be sure that the
collection name follows MongoDB restrictions-on-db-names.

**Click the name of the database where you to want to create a collection in the left navigation.**

**Click the + icon next to the database name.**

**Enter the name of the collection in the Create Collection dialog.**

**Click Create Collection to create the collection.**

### Explicit Creation

To create a new collection, log in to Atlas and do the following:

**Navigate to the Collections tab.**

**Click the + icon for the database.**

**Enter the name of the collection.**

**Optional. From the Additional Preferences dropdown, select the type of collection that you want to create.**

You can create one of the following types of collections:

- Capped collection

  If you select to create a capped collection, specify the
  maximum size in bytes.

- Time Series Collection

  If you select to create a time series collection, specify
  the time field and granularity. You can optionally specify
  the meta field and the time for old data in the collection
  to expire.

- Clustered Index Collection

  If you select to create a clustered collection, you must
  specify clustered index key value and a name for the
  clustered index.

**Click Create.**

Upon successful creation, the collection displays underneath
the database in the Atlas UI.
MongoDB provides the `db.createCollection()` method to
explicitly create a collection with various options, such as setting
the maximum size or the documentation validation rules. If you are not
specifying these options, you do not need to explicitly create the
collection since MongoDB creates new collections when you first store
data for the collections.

To modify these collection options, see `collMod`.

**Click the name of the database where you to want to create a collection in the left navigation.**

**Click the Create collection button.**

**Enter the name of the collection and optionally, configure additional preferences.**

**Click Create Collection to create the collection.**

[\|compass\|](##SUBST##|compass|) provides the following additional preferences that
you can configure for your collection:

- Create a Capped Collection
- Create a Clustered Collection
- Create a Collection with Collation
- Create a Collection with Encrypted Field

\- Create a Time Series Collection
Schema Validation
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~~

By default, a collection does not require its documents to have the
same schema; i.e. the documents in a single collection do not need to
have the same set of fields and the data type for a field can differ
across documents within a collection.

However, you can enforce schema validation rules
for a collection during update and insert operations.
See /core/schema-validation for details.

For deployments hosted in {+atlas+}, the Performance Advisor and the {+atlas+} UI detect common schema
design issues and suggest modifications that follow MongoDB best
practices. To learn more, see Schema Suggestions.

### Modifying Document Structure

To change the structure of the documents in a collection, such as add
new fields, remove existing fields, or change the field values to a new
type, update the documents to the new structure.

### Unique Identifiers

Collections are assigned an immutable UUID (Universally unique identifier). The
collection UUID remains the same across all members of a replica set
and shards in a sharded cluster.

To retrieve the UUID for a collection, run either the
listCollections command
or the `db.getCollectionInfos()` method.
